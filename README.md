# FFGenie
## Fantasy Football Lineup Helper

Visit the app at https://ffgenie.fly.dev

Pulls all fantasy football teams for any Sleeper username and provides information about the stadium, weather, and betting odds for each player and their respective team.

### HOW TO USE FFGENIE

If you don't play fantasy football on Sleeper.com you can still demo the app but typing "rosscomer" into the "Sleeper username" input box.  If you do have a Sleeper username, type that in the box.  Next, click the "Fetch User" button to pull the list of leagues associated with your username.  Finally, choose a league you would like to find out more about from the dropdown box below.  If you are demoing the app, just choose "Sportsball Championship League."

Thank you for using my app!
